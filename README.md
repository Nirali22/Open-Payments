# Open-Payments
This repository includes code to identify promising features, models and preprocessing features and use it to predict whether a payment made by a company to a medical doctor or facility was made as part of a research project or not. <br>
I have also implemented code to display the decision tree along with the conditionial expressions evaluated at each node in the tree for easy understanding.
